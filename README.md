# Project Goal

### The goal of our project was to display up to moment pricing for bitcoin in the three largest currencies.
### In the future it would be interesting to also look at the price fluctuation over time with a line graph. 

#### The visualization for our project is a bar chart of the rate of bitcoin in USD, EUR, GBP.
#### The main js library we used was the chart.js which was used for the bar graph.
