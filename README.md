## API Endpoint Documentation

## Our Crypto API: https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json
- This API contains of cryptocurrency data for several differnt countries
- Shows the rate of crypto
- Many countries are involved

### Considering the Spotify API was a struggle to use, we believed that an Open key API wuld be the best way to go as we found this on coindesk
(https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
### Our target browser is an online chrome browser, however it could be run on safari as well, meaning it successfully runs on Android and iOS browsers


# Project Goal

### The goal of our project was to display up to moment pricing for bitcoin in the three largest currencies.
### In the future it would be interesting to also look at the price fluctuation over time with a line graph.
### Our repository yields a bar graph that shows the live cryptocurrency data of the different countries in USD, EUR, and GBP
### We use ChartJS in order to graph our bar graphs, and it turned out looking great!
#### The main js library we used was the chart.js which was used for the bar graph. 
### Our project is trying to display the rate of BTC in the 3 countries, tryign to solve the question of how do these rates match up with other countries
